## Lesson 1: Variables

Variables are objects containing specific values. They serve as names appointed to values or operations that we need to perform multiple times. Understanding variables is crucial for effective programming, as they facilitate efficient time management.

### Observing the Code:

```python
x = 5  # Numeric variable
print(x)

y = "we are learning with Sir Johny"  # String variable
print(y)

x = x + 156
print(x - 1)

# Identifying the type of variable
print(type(y))
